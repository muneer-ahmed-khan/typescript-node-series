### Usage
- The ```examples``` folder contain multiple example of Creating a server, receiving requests.

- Uncomment the import statement of any imported examples file in ```main.js``` to see the result.

- run the program with command
``` npm start ```

### Main Points
- **Node.js** is single-threaded by nature, most of the Input / Output operations work in separate threads.
- The reading of the file is not interrupted it runs in a separate, parallel thread.
- Even though the Node.js is single-threaded by nature, some actions take place in separate threads.
- The library that handles asynchronous I/O is libuv and has a defined set of threads called the Worker Pool.
- The default number of threads is 4, but you can change it by setting the  UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE environment variable.
- Even if we assume that a Node.js process is single-threaded, we can still create more than one. To make a new process, we can use the child process module.
- We can control its input stream and listen to its output stream.
- **spawn** can execute any operating system command in a separate process.
- By calling spawn, we create an instance of a **ChildProcess**. Some of the things we get access from it are standard input/output streams.
- The child process module also has the exec function. It creates a shell, so you can type in a full command that you want to execute.
- The ```spawn``` function is used to spawn a new process and execute a command. It does not create a shell to execute the command, making it more efficient. It returns a spawned child process, and you can communicate with it using streams.
- The ```exec``` function is used to execute a command in a shell. It provides a callback function to capture the output and any errors.
- The ```execFile``` function is used to run an executable file directly, without using a shell. It is generally more efficient than ```exec```.
Similar to ````exec````, it provides a callback for handling output and errors.
- Advantage of ```exec``` command is fully functional shell and  ```exec``` works with callbacks instead of streams.
- The ```execFile``` function acts a bit like a combination of both ```spawn``` and ```exec```.
- In Node.js, the ```fork``` method is a variant of the ```spawn``` function provided by the ```child_process``` module.
- The primary use of ```fork``` is for creating child processes that run separate Node.js instances.
- The ```fork``` method is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to run multiple Node.js instances concurrently, each handling a specific task, and where communication between these processes is necessary.
- ```message``` Event emitted when the parent and child processes communicate using the ```send``` method.
- An important observation is that the forked process inherits the  ```process.execArgv``` property: if you use TypeScript, it contains the path to the ```ts-node``` executable. In result, the forked processes run with TypeScript too.
- To communicate with it we can take advantage of the ```message``` event. The process emits it when you use the  ```process.send() ```function to send a message.
- We call the ``` process.disconnect()``` by which the main process can stop listening for events and can come to an end.
- Otherwise, our primary process would endlessly wait for messages from the child.
- Multiple processes can work in parallel, but it is not yet multithreading programming in the conventional sense. While processes can communicate with each other, they canâ€™t share any data that they work on.
